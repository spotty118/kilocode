# LangChain Initialization Fix

## Problem Description

The LangChain context awareness feature was not working when enabled due to a race condition in the initialization process.

### Root Cause

1. `LangChainContextEnhancer` constructor started async `initializeVectorStore()` but didn't wait for completion
2. `isReady()` method returned `false` because `isInitialized` flag was still `false` during async initialization
3. `GhostContext.hasLangChainEnhancement()` used `isReady()` check, always returning `false`
4. `GhostProvider.provideCodeSuggestions()` never used enhanced context because `hasLangChainEnhancement()` was `false`
5. Users saw no LangChain context in their prompts even when properly configured

### Flow That Was Broken

```
User enables LangChain → GhostProvider checks hasLangChainEnhancement() → Always false → No enhanced context used
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Track Initialization Promise

Added `initializationPromise` field to track async initialization:

```typescript
private initializationPromise: Promise<void> | null = null
```

### 2. New Availability Check

Added `isAvailable()` method that returns `true` when enabled, even during initialization:

```typescript
isAvailable(): boolean {
    return this.config.enabled && (this.isInitialized || !!this.initializationPromise)
}
```

### 3. Updated Readiness Logic

Changed `hasLangChainEnhancement()` to use `isAvailable()` instead of `isReady()`:

```typescript
// Before: Always false during initialization
return hasEnhancer && this.langChainEnhancer!.isReady()

// After: True when enabled, regardless of initialization state  
return hasEnhancer && this.langChainEnhancer!.isAvailable()
```

### 4. Proper Async Handling

Enhanced context methods now wait for initialization to complete:

```typescript
if (this.initializationPromise && !this.isInitialized) {
    await this.initializationPromise
}
```

## Fixed Flow

```
User enables LangChain → hasLangChainEnhancement() returns true → Enhanced context requested → Waits for init if needed → LangChain context used in prompts
```

## Verification

Run the tests to verify the fix:

```bash
# Test the initialization fix
pnpm test src/services/ghost/__tests__/LangChainContextEnhancer.initialization.spec.ts

# Test the integration
pnpm test src/services/ghost/__tests__/GhostContext.langchain.spec.ts
```

## Debug Information

When LangChain is working properly, you should see these debug logs:

```
[GhostContext] hasLangChainEnhancement check - enhancer exists: true is available: true
[LangChainContextEnhancer] enhanceContext called - enabled: true
[PromptStrategyManager] Enhanced with LangChain context: {chunksCount: X, relatedFiles: Y}
```

## Impact

This fix ensures that when users enable LangChain context awareness in their settings:

1. ✅ The feature is immediately available (no race condition)
2. ✅ Enhanced context is properly generated and included in prompts
3. ✅ Users get relevant code chunks from their workspace in suggestions
4. ✅ The system works as intended without timing issues

*This fix was implemented to resolve the issue: "kilo still isn't using langchain for context awareness when it's enabled"*
